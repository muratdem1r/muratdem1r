## Hi there 👋

I'm Murat Demir, a Frontend Developer based in Türkiye.

I love building clean, scalable and modern web applications.

My main tech stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and GraphQL.
I also enjoy working with AWS, Supabase, Storyblok, and crafting smooth front-end experiences.

I’ve worked on various projects from building optimized data tables with saved filters to creating custom Next.js applications with strong UI/UX foundations. I care about performance, clarity and writing maintainable code.

I’m always improving myself, studying English (B2 → aiming higher!), preparing for global opportunities and leveling up my frontend craft every day.

Fun Facts:

- I like coffee ☕
- Into the Wild 🌳
- Hobbies: gym, video games, building things
